<h1>FPOF et malédiction de la longue traîne </h1>

                                Under submission for CNRIA'20


This directory contains our additional materials for submission to the CNRIA'20 conference. We mainly have a folder named <b>CFPOF</b> containing the source code of our method and the datasets used during the experimental phase. You will see that Organisation and Person datasets are zipped because their sizes exceed the maximun allowed by Github during the loarding phase. If someone wants to launch the CFPOF algorithm with these databases, he or she will need to unzip them first.
